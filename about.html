				<p><b>BIO:</b> I do a lot of stupid shit, and most of the time I truly believe that the people I surround myself with are the ones that drag this devil out. How about no, thats not true. Plus all that other bullshit that's not true. Most people state that "I think I'm gonna start with yoga". I'm not saying yoga is shit, yoga is a blessing to anyone sticking to it, what I am saying is that people tell themselves lies to feel good or at least feel better about themselves.<br>
				<br>
				"I make art."<br>
				<br>
				<b>FACT:</b> The pieces are mainly created during busy periods, one idea raises another, and I find myself getting effected by the environment and people around me. I'm drawn to women, desire, lust and longing. I do not follow the rules for how things should be, it is time that we stop making guidelines for what is right and wrong, and open the mind for whatever might attract one another.</p>
